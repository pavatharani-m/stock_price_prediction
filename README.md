# stock_price_prediction

1.stock_price_prediction.ipynb in any local platform and run it
    1.import thr library
        1.pandas
        2.numpy
        3.matplotlib.pyplot
        4.pandas_datareader
        5.yfinance 
        6.datetime
        7.plotly.graph_objects
        8.sklearn.preprocessing
    2.get the dataset from the yfinance library 
    3.train the model using keras layers and LSTM
    4.LSTM Input -> 3D Array (batch_size, time_steps, seq_len)LSTM 2D OR 3D
        2D -> (batch_sizem units)
        3D -> (batch_size, time_steps, units)
    5.save the model by .h5
2.run the app.py code in any platform 
3.If there is a problem then asked about a coin again run the app.py the model will give the correct output.
